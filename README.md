# Investment Memo Assistant

**A GenAI-Powered QA System for Financial Reports**

This project aims to leverage generative AI and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to extract key insights from financial reports and investment memos.

## Background and Objectives

In the Finance industry, analysts and investors are troubled by large volumes of unstructured data, such as SEC filings, financial reports, and investment memos. These documents often contain extensive details, making it time-consuming and error-prone to extract insights manually. At the same time, generative AI and retrieval-augmented generation(RAG) offer innovative solutions to address these challenges. 

This project aims to build an **Investment Memo Assistant** that leverages advanced natural language processing, vector retrieval, and large language models (LLM) to achieve the following objectives:
- **Automated Key Information Extraction:** Automatically identify and extract valuable segments from financial documents, reducing manual search efforts.
- **Intelligent Q&A Service:** Utilize an LLM to generate accurate, concise responses to user queries, complete with source citations for transparency.
- **Enhanced Efficiency:** Enable financial analysts to quickly grasp the core content of lengthy documents, allowing them to focus on strategic decision-making and in-depth analysis.
- **Compliance & Auditing:** Implement sensitive information filtering and log query data to ensure the system meets regulatory requirements and maintains transparency.

By developing this system, I aim to demonstrate how cutting-edge AI technologies can be applied to real-world financial data processing challenges and create a scalable prototype platform for future applications in finance.
